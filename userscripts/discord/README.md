keeps the good parts of the new ui (lighter mention highlights, nicer new messages line, smaller reaction padding) while removing the bad parts (message hover color, useless suggested reactions on hover, no clear indicaton of message groups in compact mode, weird spacing between messages)

usage: open your browser console, ignore the gigantic hold up message (actually read it) and the >100 errors (that's almost as many errors as interpunct bot v2 produces in an hour), paste the code, press enter

if it doesn't work: maybe discord class ids changed.
